After becoming spirits, Musashi and rival Kojiro faced off once again, but despite Musashi's confidence in his own strength, he lost their rematch to Kojiro's diligent training. Pained by his defeat, Musashi committed himself to a brutal training regimen of his own, allowing him to stand victorious over his rival the following year. Ever since, the pair have dueled once a year, each striving to gain the upper hand against an ever-improving opponent. Needless to say, both Musashi and Kojiro hate to lose.",
