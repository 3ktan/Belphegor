Since she can squeeze through the tiniest of cracks, she likes to dress up as a ghost and scare people. She ended up at the Bureau of the Occult after sneaking into a house belonging to none other than Mikado herself. No one knows exactly what took place that night, but Enenra started working for her the very next day. Whenever someone asks about it she goes pale and disappears with a poof, so people have learned not to bring it up.",
