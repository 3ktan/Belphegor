Every New Year, he and the spirits that preside over each of the six traditional New Year's games travel the country encouraging children to play these time-honored amusements. They do this by quietly placing the game equipment in front of the children who come to the park to play, and that seems to do the trick. If you ever see a New Year's game equipment in the park, it might just be a gift from New Year Game himself.",
