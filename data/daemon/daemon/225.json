Each of the five books is incredibly powerful, so since becoming a spirit, she has a kept them in separate locations. She can use the power of any of the books, but each book has a will of its own, so it's more like she asks them to lend her their power. Controlling the power is difficult, and if she mishandles it, the angels and demons come together and start fighting, and all chaos breaks loose.",
