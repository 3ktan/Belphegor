However, once she went too far and managed to bring someone back from the dead, which really pissed off Zeus. He claimed that she disrupted the laws of nature, so she has never tried reviving the dead again. But it's not clear if she stopped because he told her to, or if becoming a god made her start following the laws of nature herself.",
