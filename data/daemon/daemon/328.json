She came to the Bureau of the Occult in search of Zeus, but before she knew it she found herself bonding with the other women there. So she started a spontaneous lecture series to share her wisdom with all her new friends. Some expected it to backfire, but it worked out okay in the end. She even apologized to everyone afterwards, which shows how considerate she is. It just goes to show, you have to be strong to deal with a husband like hers.",
