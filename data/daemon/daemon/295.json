In the past she made a major series of blunders in the line of duty, later realizing they were due to her own folly and weak spirit. Aiming for self-improvement, she learned of the beach contest. She decided that appearing in front of others in a bathing suit would be a good way to strengthen her resolve, only learning about the granted wish after already deciding to participate. At that point she just considered it a stroke of good luck, or icing on the cake, if you will.",
