They are eternal rivals, constantly vying to become more popular than the other. Actually, they perform as an underground idol duo, too. But this is a well-kept secret, and even the Bureau of the Occult doesn't officially recognize it. Lots of people are secretly fans, though. Their music is pretty loud, and she is in charge of vocals and shouting.",
