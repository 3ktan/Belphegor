Kyuso can often be seeing playing with the cat spirits he's befriended, laughing as he swishes a reed back and forth for their amusement. The sight would bring a smile to the face of even the hardest of men. There are rumors that Kyuso has been sent on a secret mission by a community of rats to bring about the destruction of cats. This is most likely a lie however, as it doesn't fit with his personality.",
