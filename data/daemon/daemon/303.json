        "description": "The spirit of a sculpture in the shape of a demon. Gargoyle started life as a grotesque statue which also functioned as a rain gutter. If you ask him to explain the differences between a gargoyle and a normal sculpture, the next half day will be lost to an impromptu treatise on the subject, while the day after will be an in-depth lecture entitled \"Thus Spoke the Gargoyle\", complete with photographic examples. Finally, Gargoyle will present his listeners with reference notes containing original photos and annotations, published entirely at his own expense. This book has proven so surprisingly popular among many spirit agents that Gargoyle is thinking about a reprint and maybe even a sequel.",
