When she sees an oppressed person or someone trying to hold true to their convictions she just can't stop herself from getting involved, and many people have been dragged into situations by her interfering efforts. Still, people take kindly to her because they know how serious she is. She has actually managed to help a lot of people, and will most likely continue to do so in the foreseeable future.",
