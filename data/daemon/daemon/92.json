She is a nice, mild-mannered girl in addition to being an expert with the bow, but she's a bit weak-spirited and often finds herself in trouble. All this trouble has made her a bit of a wise woman in worldly matters, though. She's scared of crows and runs to hide whenever she sees one and waits for it to go away. When asked why, she said seeing crows gives her flashbacks to when she had to shoot down the nine sunbirds.",
