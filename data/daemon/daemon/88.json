That's how she went from being one of may shrine maidens to being the queen. She actually enjoyed being a shrine maiden, but her serious side wouldn't permit her to turn down the offer to rule the land, so she's trying to start acting more like a queen. She unexpectedly finds it very fulfilling and is completely satisfied with her own role.",
