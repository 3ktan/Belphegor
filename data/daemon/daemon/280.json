She can instantaneously transfer everything she sees onto her scroll, so you don't have to worry whether she managed to capture a special moment—she definitely got it, and much more. However, she also records things in everyday life, even when you least expect it. It's not necessarily her intention, but she tends to record things that might be a tad shocking for the people involved. Thus many in the Bureau of the Occult have learned not to take her powers lightly.",
