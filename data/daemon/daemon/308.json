        "description": "The spirit of a firework which sprays colorful sparks into the air. In the summer, this spirit travels near and far to make sure firework displays don't fizzle and flop. Roman's hair is a vertical mane of flames that acts as an emotional barometer. The more excited he becomes, the more his mane seehthes, its color growing deeper shades of red. As a result, his hair is constantly alive with activity when watchng firework displays, and explodes towards the heaves while in combat. In fact, some say that no living person has seen his hair in its normal, relaxed state...begging the question if it really can be called an emotional barometer when he only seems to have one mood: excited.",
