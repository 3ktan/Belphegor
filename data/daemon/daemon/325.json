She still sucks at acting, but her spirit essence is increasing more and more, even if that's not what she wants. Her poor performances at the end of battle are misconstrued as attempts to deceive her opponents, causing many to remark that she's not only strong but also smart. They may intend it as a compliment, but somehow she's never very happy to hear it.",
