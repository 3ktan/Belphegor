Stubbornly obsessed with \"flexibility,\" he insists that that is what makes both of them so strong. he boasts that anyone could become a great general if they simply imitate his flexible style. But nobody believes him once they see the way he wriggles and twists around in combat. Still, he continues to believe that flexibility brings strength, and makes sure to stretch every morning.",
