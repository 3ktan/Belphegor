If she's in the room when a fight breaks out, you can say goodbye to all your electronics. No doubt thanks to her elemental affiliation, Ball Lightning gets on with lightning beasts like a house on fire, so much so that when two or more of them get together in the Bureau of the Occult, you'll often hear lightning strike as they entertain each other. If ever you hear thunder in the corridors, keep away at all costs.",
