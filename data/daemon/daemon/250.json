So she was as surprised as anyone else when all of a sudden she was declared the \"most sacred beast of them all\". The stronger she gets, the more people want to come and take advantage of her powers. But, since they don't understand her spiritual nature they usually give up and go home. Still, the crowds grow bigger by the day, becoming more organized, and even beginning to function like an independent beast of their own. It's starting to scare her, to be honest.",
