In the past, she would call on her wellspring of spiritual power to create light pillars so strong they would light up the night sky bright red on almost a daily basis. However, as the millennia passed, her spiritual power began to run low, so she's had to be more careful with its use. Sometimes she breaks the rules and makes the odd light pillar here and there, but no one really knows why.",
