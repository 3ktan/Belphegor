Originally working under Firework Artisan Kagi, Tama quickly proved herself by learning all her master had to teach before setting up shop of her own, becoming her old master's friend and greatest rival. Putting her genius to good use, Tama is known for inventive, original creations, though some say they don't meet with the approval of firework traditionalists.",
