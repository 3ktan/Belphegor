        "description": "The spirit of the largest castle in Japan. Edo Castle is known to accompany spirits who think of themselves as vassals of the state. Edo Castle was said to have been constructed with feng shui and yin-yang principles in mind, giving her the impressive defensive capabilities that she's become famous for. When Edo Castle is on the defensive, she casts a protective barrier, repelling any attacks an enemy may throw at those around her. In her benevolence, she turns a blind eye to injured foes, refusing to attack. It's undoubtedly this kindness that draws other spirits; it's not uncommon to see groups of spirits congregating around her.",
