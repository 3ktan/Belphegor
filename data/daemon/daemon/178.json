With a weapon in her hand, this girl puts the \"miss\" in \"missile.\" Since forming an alliance with Sola, she has helped with many assignments. She discovered that, for some reason, whenever she's around Master, her sudden personality changes stop, and so she has started hanging out with Master a lot. She's becoming more and more frightened, however, by the looks Sola-who doesn't want Master stolen away-gives her.",
