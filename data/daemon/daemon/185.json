When she played fukuwarai, she arranged the features on the blank face so beautifully, you'd swear she wasn't wearing a blindfold—probably because she's so attached to beauty. When she played the badminton-like game hanetsuki, she got the penalty of ink painted on her face before she even understood the rules, and that made her storm off sulkily. But she returned within an hour, not wanting to spoil her New Year's experience.",
