Once upon a time, she worked for Odin, selecting the victors of major battles. But after mistakenly chosing the wrong side for victory, Brynhildr was stripped of her divine status. In shock, she retreated to the mountains. But after years of living as a recluse, she happened to run into Sigurd traveling through the mountains, and they soon hit it off. Finding happiness in Sigurd's arms, Brynhildr no longer regrets her mistake.",
