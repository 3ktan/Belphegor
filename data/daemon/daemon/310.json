Witnessing Pazuzu's horror firsthand, some people even tried to use her in the fight against other evil spirits by drawing her image on protective charms. Delighted at the portrayal of her likeness, Pazuzu befriended the humans, and set about destroying the evil that was besieging them. After an incident while exorcising evil spirits, Pazuzu herself became a spirit and built a relationship with the Bureau of the Occult. Controlling hot winds, Pazuzu works to guarantee the perfect conditions for a spirit-world firework festival. With her around, the event is sure to go off with a bang. Despite her 'evil spirit' moniker, Pazuzu is never happier than when someone she helped shows her gratitude.",
