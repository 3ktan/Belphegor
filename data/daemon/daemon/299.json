Most people assume he's evil since he's the king of the Underworld, and while this is certainly reflected in his appearance and abilities, he's actually extremely kind. And the Underworld is in fact much more peaceful than you might expect. He puts everything he's got into making sure that people have a good first impression when they arrive.",
