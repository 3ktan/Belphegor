Today, her powers are as strong as ever, and getting past her solid defenses is no small feat. However, she is a hardcore clean freak who can't stand dirt. She takes off running the minute she thinks someone is going to rub their grime off on her. When there's no escape she tries to destroy the source of contamination, what—or whoever that might be. You don't want to see the look on her face when someone actually manages to get her dirty.",
