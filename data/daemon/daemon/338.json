The sound of the flute also gives a boost of encouragement to one's allies and summons assistance from the gods. However, in today's peaceful world without any wars between the gods, he has started using his powers to relay messages from the Bureau of the Occult to expeditionary forces in distan areas with poor cellphone coverage. More than anything else his voice is just really loud, so many spirits make sure not to tell him any secrets or personal information.",
