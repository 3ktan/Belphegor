In fact, she joined the group just to improve her dancing and doesn't actually have much interest in stardom, which has left her shunned fans feeling salty. But after a certain performance where she went head-to-head with Platina, Sodium gained a newfound appreciation for the power of fandom. Her more hardcore fans weren't very happy with the new posers suddenly claiming to be Sodium fans, but they accepted her changed status nonetheless. These days, she and Platina are nearly equal in popularity.",
