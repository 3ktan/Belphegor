Living up to this reputation takes a massive amount of effort, but she doesn't see it as work—on the contrary, she believes it is her natural responsibility. But this means that she is incredibly demanding of her fellow members, too, and she's started to distance herself from those who don't live up to her expectations. After meeting several other idols from a certain event, she began thinking about the driving motivation from her early days: \"enjoying every moment.\" This led her to question what it really means to be the greatest pop star, and she realized that the answer lies beyond talent and theory, in the relationship and feeling of togetherness with one's fans.",
