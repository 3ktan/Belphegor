She once played the trick of hiding a child and ended up being frantically chased by the demon mother searching for her child. Since then, she has rarely played any tricks, maybe because she learned she shouldn't do things others don't want her to do. Now, she works for the Bureau of the Occult to prevent malicious mischief, making use of her observational skills.",
