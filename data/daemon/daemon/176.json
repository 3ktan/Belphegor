She says warming up in a kotatsu is life's greatest joy, and few can resist her allure on a cold day. She has transformed many a chilly person into an unmoving do-nothing. Even if you manage to escape, she is always right there all winter, ready to suck you back in. That explains why she is known as the \"black hole\" around the Bureau of the Occult.",
