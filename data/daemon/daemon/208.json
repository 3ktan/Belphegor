They say he was even involved with the founding of the Bureau. More recently he's been getting into doll-making. He even made a doll for the Bureau, but it didn't work out too well and he ended up getting kicked off the Support Item Development Team. That's why he started getting sent off on random assignments. But in the meantime he continues to gather parts and try to improve his creation.",
