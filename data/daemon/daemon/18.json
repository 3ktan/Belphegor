They are eternal rivals, constantly vying to become the more popular one. Actually, they perform as an underground idol duo, too. But this is a well-kept secret, and even the Bureau of the Occult doesn't officially recognize it. Lots of people are secretly fans, though. Their music is pretty loud, and she is in charge of the choruses, guitar and manipulation.",
