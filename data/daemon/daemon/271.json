When facing someone of the opposite sex her hearts starts to race, her face turns completely pale, and she starts to blush. But there is an explanation behind these outward changes: her heart races out of excitement for the coming fight; her white face signals a trance-like state of focus, and the blushing is caused by increased blood flow due to a rush of adrenaline. For her, encountering someone of the opposite sex is no different than being on the battlefield...but there's no equally sound explanation for why she's so crass.",
