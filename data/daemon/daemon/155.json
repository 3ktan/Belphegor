He slowly worked his way up to the position over the course of his life, and is very confident, with the work ethic to back it up. Lots of people love him because of the way he cares about everyone he meets. Given the terrible fires and other misfortune born from misunderstandings during his lifetime, he now tries to constantly create safe spaces where everyone can interact and come to agreement. He's definitely not just doing it for fun!",
