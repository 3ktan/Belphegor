The quality of her sound depends on who is playing -if they're talented, the roar of applause is sure to be deafening. But if they completely lack any skill, the sky and earth will probably rend apart to create a living hell. This theory was confirmed when Sola tried to play. Since then she's been making sure that only those with proper training are allowed to touch her strings.",
