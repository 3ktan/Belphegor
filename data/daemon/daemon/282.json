He became famous for putting his life on the line for the Toyotomi family he served, and he hasn't changed at all since becoming a spirit. Many spirits wish they could be like him, marching in alone and carving a path to success even when the chances of victory look slim. Currently he appears to be deeply indebted to Mikado... It's not clear why, but in any case he's not in any position to stand up to her.",
