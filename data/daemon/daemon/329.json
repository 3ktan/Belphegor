She was involved in the creation of the Ultimate Kotatsu, which had the power to sap the lifeforce out of anyone, leaving them a listless, lazy husk. It became so powerful that in just a few days it nearly wiped out humanity. But in the end it was consigned to oblivion thanks to Sola and her friends. After experiencing it herself, Kotatsu becme able to replicate the Ultimate Kotatsu's powers, with one small catch: it drains her own power too, rendering her completely useless.",
