Even before becoming a spirit she possessed incredible acrobatic powers, and now she can still leap around, ignoring the effects of rigor mortis. Apparently at one point there was a Jiangshi craze in Japan, which established her current appearance in people's minds. She was originally a vampire, but now she's a big fan of ketchup—although sometimes she drinks tomato juice instead. She gets happy at the sight of any red liquid, really.",
