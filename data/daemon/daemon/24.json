Her true form is a huge spirit, but nothing is known beyond that. With the enormous spirit essences under her control she can turn into human form and slip into human society. But these days she adjusted her looks a bit and is apparently living as a high school student. The catch is that in human form she can only use her supernatural powers for a few minutes at a time.",
