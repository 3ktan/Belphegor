She also has a reputation for her pruning skills. Being able to telepathically communicate with trees enables her use just the right techniques for each one. She can make a withered old tree go into full bloom in the blink of an eye! But if she prunes too much they'll bloom out of season the next year, so she can't work on the same tree too often. She came to town upon hearing the cries of all the cherry blossom trees there.",
