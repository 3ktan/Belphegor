Even if it's Christmas Eve, once his adrenaline gets going he just loses himself and starts slashing through everything in the Bureau of the Occult -- the walls, the ceiling, desks, everything. He's built up a huge tab for all the things he's destroyed, so he's not in a position to stand up against Mikado. He works with them as best he can, and uses the payment from the Bureau of the Occult to pay off his debt.",
