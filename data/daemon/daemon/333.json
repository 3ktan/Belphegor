A heroine among goblins, she worships the goblin gods of old and overcame great obstacles in order to obtain their ancient wisdom. No other goblins remember the old gods like she does—only she still knows their true names. These gods had the pwoer to destroy the balance of the world, and so they altered goblins' memories to prevent their religion from spreading. That was the first time she resisted the gods' wishes. She refuses to forget how they sacrificed themselves for the greater good.",
