Dedicated to making as much noise as possible with firecrackers, she appears out of nowhere to cause a commotion around Lunar New Year. She carries various firecrackers, ranging in size from very large to very small. She says, with the regulations getting stricter, she needs different firecrackers for different situations. She sure loves to explode them, but she's unexpectedly considerate when it comes to cleaning up after herself or being careful of reverberations.",
