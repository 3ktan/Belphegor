Surely it wasn't just so that she could ditch work... Pandora looked into her future, but she concluded that Belphegor will always be lazy, no matter what she does. Even in Yata Mirror's alternate world she couldn't manage to get out of a simple test grade Kotatsu. So, she's pretty much exactly what you'd expect from the demon of sloth.",
