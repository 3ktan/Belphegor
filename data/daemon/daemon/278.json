She's fond of humans on account of a loving master. And, maybe also thanks to her old master, she has a slightly philosophical bent. She's good friends with Socrates, and they often discuss things at great length. Many philosophical concepts appear quite different from the perspective of a cat, so talking with her definitely makes you think about things in a new way.",
