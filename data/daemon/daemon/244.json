He serves a prime example of the way that widespread belief in something can make it real, regardless of whether the original story is true. This pure young man is always striving to work on behalf of the people. Though his outlook may seem limited, he will one day become the leader of the nation. In preparation for this he's been learning about all sorts of things from George Washington.",
