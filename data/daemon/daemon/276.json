She also seems to have taken to caring about her appearance, constantly admiring herself whenever she passes by a mirror. Their ceremony was never actually held, but, despite the outcome she was still very happy they reaffirmed their feelings for one another. And, after everything was said and done, she apparently made off with the wedding dress and all the accessories, too.",
