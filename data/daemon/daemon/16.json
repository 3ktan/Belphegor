These days not many people go out of their way to try to understand him, so he keeps fighting, all alone. His elite lineage, combined with the explosive bursts of spirit essence granted him by his sublimated anger, make him quite powerful. Then again, maybe these rare powers have something to do with his constant loneliness.",
