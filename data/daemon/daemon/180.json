When helping with assignments, she uses whichever personality suits the situation, but it's hard for her to switch when she's emotionally overwrought. When in the victim's role, she's been known to snap and go off on violent rampages. Recently, however, she has repented of this behavior and tries to make up for it by throwing herself into her work. Surely, Santa Claus will reward her?",
