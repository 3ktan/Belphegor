Actually, his health affects the production of local crops, so when he's sick it can cause a shortage of food. As a result people are extremely nice to him, and he's gotten kind of spoiled. If he so much as pretends to be sick, people come running with food to him. Apparently a certain goddess noticed this and sent him to the Bureau of the Occult to try to build some strength and endurance.",
