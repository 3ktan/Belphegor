He's known as a villain who used his powers to get revenge on villagers who refused to pay him, but the only \"charm\" he placed on the villagers' children was to encourage them to stand up to their parents. Once they saw how glibly the adults in their lives lied to them, they decided to run away for themselves. The bad rap has hurt Hamelin's music career and cost him a lot of money... Nowadays, he always insists on being paid up front.",
