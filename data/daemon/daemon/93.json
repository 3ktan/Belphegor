He's best known for the bad things he did while alive, so lots of people get the wrong idea and avoid him at all costs. However, he regrets what he did in the past and is searching for a way to make up for it. He has the strength you'd expect from a hero and savior.  He's always concerned about the well-being of Joan of Arc, viewing her like a younger sister. He can't seem to get a long with a certain archangel for certain reasons.",
