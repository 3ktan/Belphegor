He passed up promotion after promotion in order to remain on the front lines, but people were nonetheless drawn to his strength and popularity. Before he knew it, he had a whole unit awaiting his command. He still fights on the front lines these days, but now he's got a team of allies to back him up. Much of their perceived strength is thanks to their imposing appearance, but that fact doesn't do much to put their enemies at ease.",
