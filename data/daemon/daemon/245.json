He started spending more time with Forge after the copy incident blew over, passing on all sorts of lessons and making sure to spend more time in deep self-reflection. His manner has somehow grown more soft and relaxed than before. The two Washingtons look like brothers whenever they're together...which makes sense, considering they were originally the same person.",
