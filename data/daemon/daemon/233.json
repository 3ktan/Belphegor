However, she got really angry for the first time in her life when a couple of hooligans played a really bad prank on the house where she was staying. This awakened a new power inside her. Embodying an aura of anger, she takes on the form of a dragon to fry her foes. Now she not only brings happiness, but also provides protection.",
