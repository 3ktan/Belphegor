If he were to show his true self, as the god of time, he would be able to use unspeakable power. He's not willing to do that, however, saying that his present power is just enough. Since the incident in Chinatown, his relationship with Belphegor has been restored, and now he is more attentive and caring towards her (or, more like, they have more time to spend together so he has no choice but to pay attention to her?).",
