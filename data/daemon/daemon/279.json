His popularity even rivals that of Lucifer. However, he recently got tired of dealing with fans and secretly went to work at the Bureau of the Occult. He's apparently searching for people who will treat him not as a famous model but instead as just an average spirit. Still, when he does run into the inevitable fan he treats with utmost respect, showing what a true professional he really is.",
