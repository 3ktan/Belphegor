        "description": "The spirit of a noisy firecracker. Dedicated to being as loud as possible, Firecracker turned to the two master firework artisans for assistance to grow stronger than ever. After receiving special gunpowder, Firecracker's powerful shout became a deafening roar. Although she may not soar through the sky like the rocket-type fireworks, Firecracker plays an important role in the festival, thundering along the ground and shaking spectators to their core. Even after the show is over, Firecracker entertains herself by exploding again and again...much to the ire of the Bureau of the Occult, who were swamped with noise complaints the following day.",
