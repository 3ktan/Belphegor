She gets teleported to the spot where lightning strikes against her will, regardless of whether she's in the middle of dinner or asleep in her bed. At this point, she's accepted it as a fact of life. She and Nue are close friends, and hang out so much that some people think they're sisters. However, she usually ends up getting summoned off by a lighting strike at the worst possible times whenever they're hanging out. But apparently she won't get teleported away if someone is touching her. So it's best to take a very hands-on approach when working with her.",
