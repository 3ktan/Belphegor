He's good at hiding on the side of the road at night and suddenly jumping out to scaring passerby. People have even started calling him \"Mr. Jump Scare.\" In the process of all these scary performances he's memorized every lane and back alley in town, and can run 50 meters in only four seconds. Needless to say he's giving this hobby his all.",
