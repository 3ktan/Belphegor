She makes a point to tell people that turkey is an extremely popular dish in certain parts of the world. Of course, this popularity means that many of her brethren are killed and eaten, but she explains this being an unavoidable effect of fame. She's surprisingly good at cooking, and prepares many of the dishes for the Bureau's Thanksgiving feast- including the roast turkey, naturally.",
