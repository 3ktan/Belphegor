The skeleton understands her commands to a degree, kind of like a dog - at least, that's what she says. It actually takes a huge amount of spirit essence to get it to behave properly, and there's a certain trick to it, so she's the only one who can pull it off. She's also the appointed leader of the Bureau of Occult's Roof Cleaning Unit.",
